In the Category section, a "card" is presented. In this card we have a table with all the categories presents in the database. On this "card" initially we have 2 buttons, one for returning to the Homepage, and another for adding new categories to the database. Below this the 2 buttons we have a table with the presentation of all the categories present in the database. In this table we have 3 columns, which are:

- Id: It is a generic index for organizing the table;
- Name: In these cells, the names of the categories are displayed;
